# Long-Int-Calculator

This project was created to solve the Programming Assignment #1 of a course about algorithms from Coursera. The main goal is to implement one or more of the long integer multiplication algorithms described in lecture (grade-school algorithm and Karatsuba's algorithm). But I decided to go further and implement all basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division).
